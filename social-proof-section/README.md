## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

During the building process I wanted to position the rating in the stairs-like-way by using absolute positioning. But i realised i could make the ratings container flex and then align each rating-item in it using align-self. By placing the first item of the ratings in flex-start, the 2nd in the center and the last at flex-end. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>None</h1>
```
```css

.ratings-box {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}
.rating {
  padding: 1.8rem 3.2rem;
  font-size: 2.2rem;
  color: hsl(300, 43%, 22%);
  box-shadow: 0 2px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  font-weight:700;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 2.4rem;
  background-color: hsl(300, 24%, 96%);
}

.rating-item-1 {
  align-self: flex-start;
}
.rating-item-2 {
  align-self: center;
}
.rating-item-3 {
  align-self: flex-end;
}

.card-testimonials {
  display: flex;
  gap: 3rem;
  align-items: start;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('No JsðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus on the media queries
